    ## External File Loading

    CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general.md),
     use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis,
     they're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

    Instructions:
     - Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
     - When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
     - Follow references recursively when needed
